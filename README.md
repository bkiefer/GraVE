# Graphical VOnDA Editor

This is a stripped down fork of the
[Visual Scene Maker](https://github.com/SceneMaker/VisualSceneMaker) github
repository. It only contains the graphical editor, with modified functionality
to be used with the [VOnDA](https://github.com/bkiefer/vonda) automaton
compiler, to provide similar functionality to Visual Scene Maker and
[DialogOS](https://github.com/dialogos-project/dialogos) in terms of dialogue
management based on hierarchical state machines.

The editor and compiler are still work in progress. The compiler is not yet
publicly available. It's the result of the WS17/18 software project at the
Universit√§t des Saarlandes, implemented by (in alphabetical order) Simon
Ahrendt, Max Depenbrock and Jana Jungbluth.
